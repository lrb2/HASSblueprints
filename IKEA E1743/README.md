# IKEA E1743

### Run actions on the press or hold of the on/off buttons on the TRÃ…DFRI wireless on/off switch.

My automation is very similar to that made by Zelloss99 on the Home Assistant forums [here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/zha-ikea-tradfri-on-off-switch/255538).

## Omitting an action:

1. Add a blank action
2. Edit it as YAML
3. Replace the autogenerated contents with `null`

The action you just created will no longer be visible, but the automation will now save successfully (as long as this process is repeated for every omitted action).
